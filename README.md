# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in C# where two players take turns playing against each other. 
There is a 3x3 grid of buttons that players click on. Once a player wins or the game ends, a message box will appear. 
There is also a point system to keep track of each player's points, though the points are not saved once the app is closedâ€¦ yet.

# How to Play
There are two players who use the same mouse or trackpad. Each player is highlighted above the board to indicate whose turn it is. 
The current points of each player are also displayed here, showing the total number of games each player has won.
